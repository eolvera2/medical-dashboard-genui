# Medical Dashboard GenUI Application

## Overview
A modern, AI-powered medical dashboard application implementing the DynamicUI/GenUI concept from the research paper. This application features a sophisticated three-panel layout with drag-and-drop functionality, real-time AI generation capabilities, and a comprehensive medical information management system designed with the Fluent 2 design system.

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **GenUI Integration**: Natural language interface for generating dashboard components
- **Drag-and-Drop Modules**: Intuitive module management system
- **Three-Panel Layout**: 
  - Left: Patient information and available modules
  - Center: Dynamic workspace
  - Right: Clinical checklist and actions

### üè• Medical Features
- Patient information display with chief complaint tracking
- Vital signs monitoring with trend indicators
- Chronic conditions and risk factor management
- Differential diagnosis table with probability indicators
- Clinical guidelines integration
- Laboratory results tracking
- SOAP note documentation
- Body map visualization
- Patient timeline

### üé® Design System
- Modern Fluent 2 Design System implementation
- Clean, professional medical aesthetic
- Responsive layout (adapts to different screen sizes)
- Dark mode support
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessibility-focused design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No installation required - runs entirely in the browser

### Running the Application
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. The dashboard will load with sample patient data

### Using GenUI Features
1. **Generate Components**: 
   - Type a request in the prompt field (e.g., "Add cardiac risk assessment")
   - Press Enter or click "Generate"
   - AI will create and add relevant components to the workspace

2. **Drag and Drop**:
   - Drag modules from the left panel
   - Drop them into the center workspace
   - Modules automatically populate with relevant data

3. **Checklist Management**:
   - Click checkboxes to mark items complete
   - Progress bar updates automatically
   - Use action buttons to initiate clinical workflows
