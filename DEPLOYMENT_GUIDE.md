# ðŸš€ Medical Dashboard Deployment Guide

## Your Application is Ready for Azure Static Web Apps!

### âœ… What We've Completed
- [x] Created Azure deployment configuration (`staticwebapp.config.json`)
- [x] Added `.gitignore` for clean repository
- [x] Initialized Git repository with `main` branch
- [x] Committed all files (2 commits ready)
- [x] Added comprehensive deployment documentation

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps - Quick Start

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `medical-dashboard-genui` (or your choice)
3. Keep it **Public** (required for free Azure tier)
4. **DON'T** initialize with README (you already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

Copy and run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-dashboard-genui.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Azure (Web Portal Method - Easiest!)

1. **Go to Azure Portal**: https://portal.azure.com
2. **Create Static Web App**:
   - Click "Create a resource" (+ icon)
   - Search for "Static Web App"
   - Click "Create"

3. **Fill in the form**:
   ```
   Subscription: [Your subscription]
   Resource Group: Create new â†’ "medical-dashboard-rg"
   Name: medical-dashboard-genui
   Region: [Choose closest to you]
   Plan type: Free
   ```

4. **Connect to GitHub**:
   ```
   Source: GitHub
   Click "Sign in with GitHub" (authorize if needed)
   Organization: [Your GitHub username]
   Repository: medical-dashboard-genui
   Branch: main
   ```

5. **Build Details**:
   ```
   Build Presets: Custom
   App location: /
   Api location: [Leave empty]
   Output location: [Leave empty]
   ```

6. **Create**: Click "Review + create" â†’ "Create"

## Step 4: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

Azure will:
1. Create a GitHub Action workflow in your repo
2. Build and deploy your app automatically
3. Provide you with a live URL

## Step 5: Access Your Live App

Your app will be available at:
```
https://[your-app-name].azurestaticapps.net
```

Example: `https://medical-dashboard-genui.azurestaticapps.net`

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Checklist

After deployment, you should be able to:
- [ ] Access your app via the Azure-provided URL
- [ ] See your medical dashboard running live
- [ ] Test the GenUI prompt functionality
- [ ] Drag and drop modules
- [ ] Share the URL with others

## ðŸ”„ Automatic Updates

Every time you:
1. Make changes locally
2. Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Your message"`
3. Push: `git push`

Azure automatically redeploys your app! (Usually takes 1-2 minutes)

## ðŸ“Š Monitor Your App

- **GitHub Actions**: See build status at github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-dashboard-genui/actions
- **Azure Portal**: View metrics, logs, and settings in your Static Web App resource

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### If GitHub push fails:
```bash
# Check your remote
git remote -v

# If no remote, add it:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-dashboard-genui.git
```

### If Azure deployment fails:
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for error logs
2. Verify all files are committed
3. Ensure repository is public (for free tier)

### Common Issues:
- **404 Error**: Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- **Build fails**: Check that all files are present in GitHub
- **Authentication issues**: Re-authorize GitHub in Azure Portal
